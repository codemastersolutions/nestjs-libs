# Security Guidelines for Better Auth Library

This document outlines the security improvements and best practices implemented in the Better Auth NestJS library.

## Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. Information Disclosure Prevention

**Issue**: Debug logs were exposing sensitive information including request paths, URLs, and request bodies.

**Solution**: 
- Removed all debug console.log statements that could leak sensitive data
- Implemented secure error logging that only logs error types, not sensitive details
- Added structured logging for security-relevant events

### 2. Host Header Injection Protection

**Issue**: The middleware was using the `Host` header directly without validation, making it vulnerable to Host Header Injection attacks.

**Solution**:
- Added validation and sanitization of the `Host` header
- Implemented allowlist-based host validation
- Added fallback to `localhost` for invalid hosts
- Sanitized host values to prevent injection attacks

### 3. JSON Injection Prevention

**Issue**: Request body serialization was performed without proper validation.

**Solution**:
- Added existence check before serializing request body
- Implemented safe JSON serialization practices
- Added input validation for request objects

### 4. Token Collision Prevention

**Issue**: Dependency injection tokens were using string literals, creating potential for token collisions.

**Solution**:
- Migrated from string tokens to Symbol-based tokens
- Updated all injection points to use symbols
- Maintained backward compatibility through re-exports

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling

**Issue**: Error handling could expose sensitive information or create inconsistent response patterns.

**Solution**:
- Implemented secure error handling that prevents information leakage
- Added consistent error responses for security errors
- Enhanced logging for security-relevant errors without exposing sensitive data

### 6. Input Validation

**Issue**: Insufficient validation of input parameters in service methods.

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive input validation for all service methods
- Implemented type checking and existence validation
- Added proper error messages for invalid inputs

## Security Configuration Options

The library provides several security-related configuration options with clear warnings:

### `disableMiddleware`
⚠️ **SECURITY WARNING**: Disabling middleware removes authentication protection. Only disable if you have alternative authentication mechanisms in place.

### `disableExceptionFilter`
⚠️ **SECURITY WARNING**: Disabling exception filter may expose sensitive error information. Consider the security implications before disabling.

### `disableTrustedOriginsCors`
⚠️ **SECURITY WARNING**: Disabling CORS protection can expose your application to cross-origin attacks. Only disable if you have alternative CORS protection or understand the security implications.

## Best Practices for Users

### 1. Configuration Security
- Always review security-related configuration options before disabling them
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration values
- Implement proper CORS policies for production environments

### 2. Monitoring and Logging
- Monitor authentication-related errors in your application logs
- Implement proper log rotation and secure log storage
- Set up alerts for suspicious authentication patterns

### 3. Network Security
- Always use HTTPS in production environments
- Implement proper firewall rules
- Use trusted reverse proxies when applicable

### 4. Regular Updates
- Keep the Better Auth library updated to the latest version
- Monitor security advisories for dependencies
- Regularly audit your authentication implementation

## Security Testing

The library includes comprehensive security tests covering:
- Host header injection prevention
- Error handling security
- Input validation
- Token collision prevention
- Response consistency

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in this library, please report it responsibly:

1. Do not create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
2. Contact the maintainers directly
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for the issue to be addressed before public disclosure

- [ ] HTTPS is enabled for all authentication endpoints
- [ ] Proper CORS policies are configured
- [ ] Error logging is configured securely
- [ ] Input validation is working correctly
- [ ] Host header validation is enabled
- [ ] Security tests are passing
